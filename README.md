## TL;DR

A bot for `team` members to curate community shared links to notion.  ✍️

## How it Works

1. Member posts link to discord with context, in a specific category `#channel`
2. Anyone with `Team` role adds a 📌 emoji -> message content is posted to Notion Table
    - message content
    - member discord handle
    - category (ie. channel that shared in)
    - date/time
    - (ideal) source of the link ✌️

## Setup

1. Fork the repository to your gihub account (top right hand corner)
2. Clone the fork to your local system
3. Install Node modules `yarn`
4. Local dev 👉 `yarn dev` : runs ts-node to compile and run
5. Before release build with `yarn build` : runs typescript and compiles to `build` dir
6. Release runs with -> `yarn start`

## Submitting your improvements

1. Create a new branch `git check -b <your branch name>`
2. `git add .`
3. `git commit -m 'fix(example): semantic versioning is cool'`
4. `git push`
5. Grab that PR and point it to our main branch
6. Message with changes for a review ! :v:
